                    <p>hound is a project created by Drew Beamer. Inspired by Drewâ€™s love of dogs and social media, hound tracks user interactions with the site and presents them to the user in order to raise questions about surveillance and tracking on the Internet.</p>
                    <h4>Privacy</h4>             <p>
                        This site is intended to raise awareness about privacy on the web.

                        hound does not store any information outside of the session.
                        Hound has no database and does not use cookie. While you are on the site, hound uses a React state to keep track of
                        the current weights to get each image with, and then fetches images from our server using those weights.
